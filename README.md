# Fortnite_Cheats

- This was tested on my friend's PS4 and it was successful these cheats only work the PS4 version of fortnite, however you are more then welcome to try them on the next generation consoles and xbox one. I am not 100% sure if they work on those platforms, but I did write the script to detect the controls on Xbox as well, but I have not tested them yet.

- Update: Unfortunately Epic Games patched external mods, therefore I will be working on a way to fix this in the hopes that I can get this running again I will be waiting on a few friends to tackle this issue, so I am not sure when I can update this with the newest update.
